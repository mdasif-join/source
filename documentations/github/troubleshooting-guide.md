Here are the issues I've had with GitHub so far for easy troubleshooting.

**1. Cloning a Repository:**
   - Clone a repository from a remote URL to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

**2. Initializing a Repository:**
   - Create a new Git repository in your current directory.
   ```
   git init
   ```

**3. Checking Repository Status:**
   - View the status of your local repository, including untracked, modified, and staged files.
   ```
   git status
   ```

**4. Adding Changes to Staging Area:**
   - Stage changes for the next commit.
   ```
   git add <file(s)>
   ```

**5. Committing Changes:**
   - Create a new commit with staged changes and a commit message.
   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```

**6. Pulling Changes:**
   - Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository into your local branch.
   ```
   git pull
   ```

**7. Pushing Changes:**
   - Push your local commits to the remote repository.
   ```
   git push
   ```

**8. Branching:**
   - Create a new branch or switch to an existing branch.
   ```
   git branch <branch_name>
   git checkout <branch_name>
   ```

**9. Merging Branches:**
   - Merge changes from one branch into another.
   ```
   git merge <branch_name>
   ```

**10. Creating a New Repository on GitHub:**
    - Create a new remote repository on GitHub.
    - You can do this through the GitHub web interface.

**11. Adding a Remote Repository:**
    - Add a remote repository URL to your local repository.
    ```
    git remote add <remote_name> <repository_url>
    ```

**12. Forking a Repository:**
    - Create a copy of someone else's repository on your GitHub account.
    - You can do this through the GitHub web interface.

**13. Pull Requests:**
    - Create a pull request to propose changes to a repository.
    - You can do this through the GitHub web interface.
